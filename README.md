# Figure_Out_SSS
Aim: To create C/C++ program implementing Shamir Secret Sharing Algorithm with the following features:  The applet should accept a byte array of size 32. For eg - private byte[] secret = new byte[32]; The applet should form 4 shares where the secret could be reconstructed from any 2 shares. Apply Shamir secret sharing scheme to each byte separately and use Galois Field(256) as the underlying finite field. Y coordinate corresponding to the same X coordinates shall be stored in the same byte array for each share. The applet should accept M number of byte array and reconstruct the original secret using Shamirâ€™s Algorithm. Notes: The applicant is free to do research about the algorithm online. No external library (accept for generating random numbers) shall be used.
